My Journeyman's Piece is ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ POInterest - London Airbnb Explorer ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

A tool that uses Overpass API & Selenium to find the optimal environment of Airbnbs for specific traveler types out of Airbnb, Openstreetmaps & Google Maps. It is visualized with a Tableau Dashboard which:

<p>(1) filters your individual needs and interests</p>
<p>(2) checks for fair prices and good ratings via linear regression</p>
<p>(3) helps you understanding your neighbourhood better</p>
<p>(4) books you an Airbnb directly in the Dashboard</p>
<p> </p>
