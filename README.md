A Tool, which filters the perfect neighbourhood for specific traveller types out of Airbnb, Google Maps & Open Street Map via Overpass API Pipeline & Selenium. It is visualized as a Tableau Dashboard, which:

<p>(3) helps you understanding your neighbourhood better</p>
<p>(4) books you an Airbnb directly in the Dashboard</p>
